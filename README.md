# DL-for-beginners
in this second course I have learned about neural networks and the techniques to fix the overfitting and underfitting problems and to make a better accuracy using Tensorflow and also I have learned about decision trees and the Algorithms used to treat the data in this trees like Random forest and XGboost...
